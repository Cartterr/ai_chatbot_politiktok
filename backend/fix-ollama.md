# WSL to Windows Networking Bridge

After reviewing your situation and the Reddit thread, it's clear we're dealing with a common WSL-Windows networking issue. Here's a step-by-step solution:

## Solution 1: Port Forwarding from Windows to WSL

This is the most reliable approach:

1. **Run this command in Windows PowerShell as Administrator**:

```powershell
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=172.19.16.1 listenport=11434 connectaddress=127.0.0.1 connectport=11434
```

This command tells Windows to forward any connection coming to 172.19.16.1:11434 (the WSL interface IP) to 127.0.0.1:11434 (where Ollama is listening on Windows).

2. **Verify the port forwarding is working**:

```powershell
netsh interface portproxy show all
```

3. **Update the ollama_client.py file** with the WSL IP hardcoded (see other artifact).

4. **Test the connection from WSL**:

```bash
curl http://172.19.16.1:11434/api/tags
```

## Solution 2: Configure Ollama to Listen on All Interfaces

If Solution 1 doesn't work, we can also try to make Ollama listen on all interfaces:

1. **Stop Ollama in Windows**
2. **Create/modify `C:\Users\GAMING\.ollama\config.json`**:

```json
{
  "host": "0.0.0.0:11434"
}
```

3. **Restart Ollama**
4. **Verify it's listening on all interfaces**:

```powershell
netstat -an | findstr :11434
```

You should see `0.0.0.0:11434` in the output instead of `127.0.0.1:11434`.

## Solution 3: WSL Socat Proxy (If Nothing Else Works)

As a last resort, we can run a proxy in WSL:

1. **Install socat in WSL**:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install socat
```

2. **Create a proxy that forwards WSL localhost to Windows**:

```bash
socat TCP-LISTEN:11435,fork TCP:host.docker.internal:11434
```

3. **Modify ollama_client.py to use localhost:11435**

## Troubleshooting

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check Windows Firewall**:
   - Ensure Windows Firewall isn't blocking connections on port 11434
   - Add an exception for Ollama in Windows Firewall settings

2. **Test local connectivity in Windows**:
   - In Windows Command Prompt: `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags`

3. **Verify WSL networking is working**:
   - In WSL: `ping 8.8.8.8` to verify internet connectivity
   - In WSL: `ping 172.19.16.1` to verify you can reach the WSL interface on Windows
